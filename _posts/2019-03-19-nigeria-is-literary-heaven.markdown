In my short 2-week stay, I just got a small/small taste of Nigeria's deep and rich literary history.<br />
<ul>
<li>During the second day there, I learned that I had just missed <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/wole-soyinka">Wole Soyinka</a> by hours during our visit to <a href="https://www.cometonigeria.com/wheretogo/freedom-park-lagos/">Freedom Park on Lagos Island</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tundeodunladeblog.com/bio/">Tunde Odunlade</a>, multidisciplinary artist, and our gracious host introduced me to the journalist, poet <a href="https://everythinliterature.blogspot.com/2011/09/nigerian-literature-is-fascinating-and_14.html">Jare Ajaye</a> who turned me on to the work of the prolific poet <a href="http://new.uno.edu/profile/faculty/niyi_osundare">Niyi Osundare</a> (I’m devouring his <u>City Without Walls: the Katrina Poems</u>.) Jare supported my wife's (<a href="https://www.carylhenryalexander.com/">Caryl Henry Alexander</a>) show during her first trip to Nigeria.</li>
<li>If you’re ever in Ibadan, do yourself a favor and stop by Dr. Kolonde Mosuro’s <a href="https://booksellers.ng/">Booksellers</a> Bookshop</li>
<li>I had a chance to read <a href="http://files.constantcontact.com/020c4053701/3fe7f662-e77e-444a-96a7-25f16f545569.pdf">my poem hunger #1</a> at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/afibadan">Alliance Française</a> Ibadan open mike where I met the photographer/activist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nseabasi.akpan">Nseabasi Akpan</a></li>
<li>I also met the actor <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kfamoriyo">Kunle Famoriyo</a> who recited a piece from Soyinka’s The Trials of Brother Jero at a gathering in Tunde’s studio</li>
</ul>
<p>
I was only able to get two names of women poets to explore: <a href="https://www.theijeoma.com/">Ijeoma Umebinyu</a>, <a href="http://pandeliterary.com/pl_author/lola-shoneyin/">Lola Shoneyin</a></p>
<p>
I’ll have to return for a more in-depth “literary tour” sometime.</p>
