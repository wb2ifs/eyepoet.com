Santa ain't coming  
this year  
sleigh mired in thawed tundra  

the tooth fairy has  
west nile  
pale, she shivers gasping last breaths  

tokyo is dark  
godzilla, gorged on fuel rods  
lies face down in a pool of his own nuclear waste  

the Marians peering through once envious telescopes  
call off the invasion  
another oil spill wounds the ocean  

even monsters don't want  
our world  
they abandon our dreams  
leaving only silent  
enveloping  
darkness.
