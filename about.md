<b>personal statement:</b>
"I have been writing poetry and prose, and blowing fuses since I was 8 years old...and I write to collect the various and sundry parts of myself and project them into the future. My storytelling Mother taught me how to love a song for the song's sake, and my non-profit executive Father taught me to appreciate the structure in all things..."</P>
