Hello and welcome to my new blog site. Here are the reasons for my bringing this site into (re)exsistance:
* I'm tired of the cray/cray stuff going on in social media.
* I created it in _[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)_ for the same reason that people climb Mount Everest--because it's there and because I want better control over my content.
* This site is the new home for scipoet and eyepoet stuff
* I'm going to link back to my social media from here but this place will be the "single source of truth" for my content--meaning it will be published here first
* I'm feeling my mortality (yeah, I know, I'm a little late..) and, like one of my mentors [Ray Storey](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mentor-ray-light-jesse-alexander/) would say, I want to leave y'all pieces of my thought process so that I get to live forever
* I'm tired of the "choice me" syndrome that operates in the poetry and corporate worlds. I want to see if there's another way around the gate-keepers in the ivy-incrusted towers

By the way, if you look down at the bottom of the page and all the other pages, you will see that this material is "copy left". Please [contact me first](/contact/) if you want to collaborate or reuse any of this material.
