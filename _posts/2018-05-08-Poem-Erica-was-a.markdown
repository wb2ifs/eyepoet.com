([blackjack](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BlackjackPoets/) Elegy for [Erica Garner](https://www.bustle.com/p/erica-garner-was-a-warrior-one-year-after-her-death-that-legacy-lives-on-15573485S), Daughter of [Eric Garner](https://www.democracynow.org/topics/eric_garner))   

#1.  
Daddyâ€™s girl: died giving breath   
To a manchild named after her  
father: whose breath was stolen  

On the street by a police  
man: whose apology was not  
Enough to silence her voice

For Justice. Her death was  
too ordinary, too black  
Too small for such a big life.  

#2.  
Deep obsidian vessel  
Bursting with brilliant blood  
Red roses and deep purple  

[Periwinkles](http://slaveryandremembrance.org/partners/partner/?id=P0087). Wild blossoms  
Spilling out from her every-  
which-way. Roots cracking Staten  

Island sidewalks. Eye want to give  
You medals of flowers as  
Freely as you gave your life.  

#3.  
Savior. She, like too many  
Women, gather our broken  
Pieces from the streets, from back  

Roads, floating in rivers, creeks,  
& streams & try to stitch us  
back together again good  

Like knew, the way they new us  
With only the light of their  
Laboring lives to work by.
